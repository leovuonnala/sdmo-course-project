# sdmo-course-project
Course project for Software Development, Maintenance and Operations

## How to use it:
Create a file with repo urls, name it "urls.txt". Download RefactoringMiner and place the urls.txt file in the bin
folder of it. Put main.py also in there with scc as well. After pydriller is implemented, it will also need a
venv since we need pip for downloading it.
cd to bin and type "python3 main.py". the tool does the rest of the work.

currently gets commit history using RefactoringMiner and basic output of scc
